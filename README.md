# TIL ðŸš€

## "Today I learn" is a repo that shows my study route for inspiring others in the magical world of programming!

A collection of concise write-ups on small ideas that I learn _day to day_ across a
variety of languages and technologies.
With this, I wish to build rapport and engagement among the community for future opportunities!

âœ¨ _5 TILs and counting..._

### Activity: ðŸ˜€

#### Today:

- Learned the power of the _factory_ architecture, the way of making the code more organized and concise.
- Besides, learned how to make _injection of dependency_ in the main function to make _automated test_ -with Jest- easier.
  Example: ```js

##### 1. 12/1/20201 - JS actions

- Finished the Github Actions course for working with Javascript actions: [Link](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).
- Learned to use _WSL Ubuntu_, which instigate me learning more about git config, conventional commit; command-line interface.

##### 2 .13/1/2021 - Terminology and study for stacks in the market

- Finished the course about publishing to GitHub packages: [Repo](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/github-actions-for-packages/)
- Start to analyze language CodeQl for understanding about bootstrap's vulnerability in JQuery: [repo for study](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/codeql-javascript-unsafe-jquery-plugin).
- Learn about Google's process to be hired: how to manage the interview questions about algorithms and data structure, stacks, values, and many more. Hence, started to study in [FreecodeCampe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk).
- Learn about Halts Theory and process by Alan Turning to prove that _"computers won't be able to solve every problem that we[as humans] give to them"_;
- Studied the "problem" of multithread and real-time programming to improve my understanding over Node.js. [Check out introduction video by Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY_2gElt3SA).

##### 3. 14/1/2021 - DNA-RNA

- I was seeing difficulties in writing code faster, although I've become a faster typer. Hence, make my programming more productive and achieve more code with less effort is what I'm searching for at the moment. Likewise, I searched and implemented extensions for VsCode.
- Refactor of a [real application](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/rnaedna) from **Python** to **HTML, CSS, and JS**. This program is responsible for doing the translation of DNA to RNAm, and vice-versa.

##### 4. 15/1/2021 - CodeQl && Security

- Submitted an issue to implement .ql icon in the vscode extension [material themes icon](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme/issues/931).
- And, as I studied CodeQl, I saw the opportunitie to make the course [security on GitHub](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/security-on-github/) to really understand the basics of how GitHub deal with.

##### 5. 16/1/2021 - JS30

- Finished the course [JS30](https://javascript30.com/), which helped me -a lot in- expanding the mind about vanilla JS: localStorage, events in general, functions, the structure of arrays, and a lot more. A highly recommended and transforming course that allows programmers and designers to understand the underly logic in Javascript, whereas seeing the possibilities that we can create.
- Studying the possibility of translating the course JS30.

##### 6. 17/1/2021 - Software Architecture

- Learned the power of the _factory_ architecture, the way of making the code more organized and concise.
- Besides, learned how to make _injection of dependency_ in the main function to make _automated test_ -with Jest- easier.
  Example: ```js

export default function core(configuration = {}) {
function start() {
console.log("[Initializing] core...");
//const database = configuration.db ? require('./database') : console.log('No db')
}
function end() {
console.log("[Closing core] ");

    console.log("[Closing app] database.js");

}
}

```
