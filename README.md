# TIL ðŸš€

## "Today I learn" is a repo that shows my study route for inspiring others in the magical world of programming!

A collection of concise write-ups on small ideas that I learn _day to day_ across a
variety of languages and technologies.
With this, I wish to build rapport and engagement among the community for future opportunities!

âœ¨ _20 TIL's and counting..._

#### Python's Olympiad History

The year was 2018, my principal called me; at this moment, I thought: "Oh, I'm in (real) trouble"! Instead, he offers me the **opportunity** to participate in the [OBI](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/) ("OlimpÃ­ada Brasileira de InformÃ¡tica" - translation), a National Olympiad of Programming in Brazil. I felt anxious as hell; replied: "sure"!
As I went in my preparation, learning the classic Python language, I started to think like a programmer in term of: conditions, iterations, functions, and opened for me a completely magical world - machines doing tasks. This sentiment of controlling what the computer will do, and no longer a passive experience.
My first line of code was very probably

```py
 print("Hello, World!")
```

, thus, starting in the right way.
After weeks of not understanding the order of coding, loops and how computers actually know how to execute the lines of code - I presumed that computer could magically re-run the code-, for example:

```py
name = 'Diogo'
if name == 'test':
print('Aha!')
name = test
```

And didn't make sense to me why was not printing "Aha!".
Today, I can assure that I know why that's not the case, even though React kind of made my wish possible.
Finally, I passed the first step of the OBI, which was Municipal. I could not control my feelings, felt like a little Kanguru jumping around happy in the middle of my house.
Going on to the State Stage, I passed and went to the National. For a pupil in the eight year, inside the most advanced research center in the country (ITA), coding Python in an Intel's i7 processor, I could not be happier.
In the middle of the 3 hour final test, I pondered about winning a medal- unfortunately didn't happen- but not even one question I couldn't answer. One question was about matrices, the order about graph theory with cities, like BFS, and the order some loops, wich I didn't figure out.
So, at the end, I learned a lot of stuff, including: programming, the importance of practicing, writing clean code and a ton more that in this roadmap/TIL, You can get into.
My advice is to never stop to study and pursue your objectives.

##### 12/1/20201 - JS actions

- Finished the Github Actions course for working with Javascript actions: [Link](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).

- Finished the course about publishing to GitHub packages: [Repo](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/github-actions-for-packages/)
- Start to analyze language CodeQl for understanding about bootstrap's vulnerability in JQuery: [repo for study](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/codeql-javascript-unsafe-jquery-plugin).
- Learn about Google's process to be hired: how to manage the interview questions about algorithms and data structure, stacks, values, and many more. Hence, started to study in [FreecodeCampe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk).
- Learn about Halts Theory and process by Alan Turning to prove that _"computers won't be able to solve every problem that we[as humans] give to them"_;
- Studied the "problem" of multithread and real-time programming to improve my understanding over Node.js. [Check out introduction video by Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY_2gElt3SA).

##### 14/1/2021 - DNA-RNA

- I was seeing difficulties in writing code faster, although I've become a faster typer. Hence, make my programming more productive and achieve more code with less effort is what I'm searching for at the moment. Likewise, I searched and implemented extensions for VsCode.
- Refactor of a [real application](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/rnaedna) from **Python** to **HTML, CSS, and JS**. This program is responsible for doing the translation of DNA to RNAm, and vice-versa.

##### 15/1/2021 - CodeQl && Security

- Submitted an issue to implement .ql icon in the vscode extension [material themes icon](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme/issues/931).
- And, as I studied CodeQl, I saw the opportunitie to make the course [security on GitHub](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/security-on-github/) to really understand the basics of how GitHub deal with.

##### 16/1/2021 - JS30

- Finished the course [JS30](https://javascript30.com/), which helped me -a lot in- expanding the mind about vanilla JS: localStorage, events in general, functions, the structure of arrays, and a lot more. A highly recommended and transforming course that allows programmers and designers to understand the underly logic in Javascript, whereas seeing the possibilities that we can create.
- Studying the possibility of translating the course JS30.

##### 17/1/2021 - Software Architecture

- Learned the power of the _factory_ architecture, the way of making the code more organized and concise.
- Besides, learned how to make _injection of dependency_ in the main function to make _automated test_ -with Jest- easier.
  Example: ```js

export default function core(configuration = {}) {
function start() {
console.log("[Initializing] core...");
//const database = configuration.db ? require('./database') : console.log('No db')
}
function end() {
console.log("[Closing core] ");

    console.log("[Closing app] database.js");

}
}
