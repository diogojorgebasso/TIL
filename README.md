# TIL
> Today I learn
## "Today I learn" is a repo that shows my study route for inspiring others in the magical wolrd of programming!

A collection of concise write-ups on small ideas that I learn *day to day* across a
variety of languages and technologies.
With this, I wish to build rapport and engajament among communitie and future oportunities!
