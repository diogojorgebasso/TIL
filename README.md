# TIL ðŸš€

## "Today I learn" is a repo that shows my study route for inspiring others in the magical world of programming!

A collection of concise write-ups on small ideas that I learn _day to day_ across a
variety of languages and technologies.
With this, I wish to build rapport and engagement among the community for future opportunities!

âœ¨ _20 TIL's and counting..._

#### Python's Olympiad History

The year was 2018, my principal called me; at this moment, I thought: "Oh, I'm in (real) trouble"! Instead, he offers me the **opportunity** to participate in the [OBI](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/) ("OlimpÃ­ada Brasileira de InformÃ¡tica" - translation), a National Olympiad of Programming in Brazil. I felt anxious as hell; replied: "sure"!
As I went in my preparation, learning the classic Python language, I started to think like a programmer in term of: conditions, iterations, functions, and opened for me a completely magical world - machines doing tasks. This sentiment of controlling what the computer will do, and no longer a passive experience.
My first line of code was very probably

```py
 print("Hello, World!")
```

, thus, starting in the right way.
After weeks of not understanding the order of coding, loops and how computers actually know how to execute the lines of code - I presumed that computer could magically re-run the code-, for example:

```py
name = 'Diogo'
if name == 'test':
print('Aha!')
name = test
```

And didn't make sense to me why was not printing "Aha!".
Today, I can assure that I know why that's not the case, even though React kind of made my wish possible.
Finally, I passed the first step of the OBI, which was Municipal. I could not control my feelings, felt like a little Kanguru jumping around happy in the middle of my house.
Going on to the State Stage, I passed and went to the National. For a pupil in the eight year, inside the most advanced research center in the country (ITA), coding Python in an Intel's i7 processor, I could not be happier.
In the middle of the 3 hour final test, I pondered about winning a medal- unfortunately didn't happen- but not even one question I couldn't answer. One question was about matrices, the order about graph theory with cities, like BFS, and the order some loops, wich I didn't figure out.
So, at the end, I learned a lot of stuff, including: programming, the importance of practicing, writing clean code and a ton more that in this roadmap/TIL, You can get into.
My advice is to never stop to study and pursue your objectives.

> "The 'no' you already have, so go beyond and don't EVER be afraid to pursue"

#### Today:

- Finished the course in SoloLearn React + Redux

- Summary:

Redux can be described using the following principles:

###### Single source of truth

The global state of the app is stored in a single store.

###### State is read-only

You can change the state only by dispatching actions. Action are objects, that contain information about what should be changed.

###### Pure reducers

Reducers are functions that handle the actions and return the next state of the application. Reducers need to be pure, meaning they cannot modify the state, they need to return a new state object.

export default function core(configuration = {}) {
function start() {
console.log("[Initializing] core...");
//const database = configuration.db ? require('./database') : console.log('No db')
}
function end() {
console.log("[Closing core] ");

    console.log("[Closing app] database.js");

}

##### 23/2/2021 - Learned about Redux with React

- Finished the course in SoloLearn React + Redux, [available here](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1097-20647754/jpg)

  - [first_assignment](https://react-contact-manager-4-qltv3e.stackblitz.io)

- Summary:

Redux can be described using the following principles:

###### Single source of truth

The global state of the app is stored in a single store.

###### State is read-only

##### 24/2/2021 - Learned a precious tip in JS

###### Donâ€™t use delete to remove an item from array

- Use **splice** instead of using delete to delete an item from an array. Using **delete** replaces the item with _undefined_ instead of removing it from the array.
  - Checkout one live example in [gist](https://gist.github.com/diogojorgebasso/c60ebac465a2c1a82c11e0fe6e24561d)
